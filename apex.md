### Resume Building (Project Based Resume)
* Remove the skills section because the skills described are displayed in the projects that are built, those skills are required to complete the project
* The Resume:
    * Page 1
        * Personal Info
            * Name, Title, Address, Number, Email, Github, LinkedIn, etc.
        * Innovate Bham - Line 18
        * Projects
        * Include the Agile and Scrum training (not certified but understand the concept and was able to apply it in that scenario)
    * Page 2
        * Other Work Experience
        * Other Education

### Tips and Important Information
* Use every staffing firm in town
* "Innovate Bham is a 500+ hour intensive project based program that focuses on learning JavaScript using the Covalence certified program."
* Include your projects in your resume in the projects section and describe them
    * Include the languages used to build it as you describe them
* Be able to describe in an interview what we did over the course of the program
* Questions to recruiting/staffing firms:
    * Ask about fees out of paychecks
        * How do you (the recruiters) get paid?
    * Do I have a say in where my resume goes?
* Take every interview you can
* **KNOW YOUR RESUME**
* Do your research
    * Research the company
    * Research tech that is relevant to the job that is unknown or confusing to you so that you can be able to point out that you have researched it (initiative) and are willing to learn (eagerness)
* Don't rely on recruiting/staffing firms
    * They can be very helpful but you need to put in your own effort
* Apex offers career coaching
* Companies are more likely to take a chance on bootcamp grads with contract-to-hire work
    * Pay attention to the way the manager/interviewer describes the position
        * Project Talk (Temporary Position) vs Team Talk (Long-Term Position)
* Finding a job should be a full-time job
