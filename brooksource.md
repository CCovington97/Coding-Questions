### Job Searching
#### Where do I Start?
* Figure out what you want to do, and what you are interested in! This can be a company you're interested in, a specific language you want to code in, or simply a job you've heard about.
* Research Companies, Glassdoor reviews, and skillsets needed in market
* Create your most updated resume, and post on job-searching sites
    * LinkedIn
    * Indeed
    * Dice.com
    * CareerBuilder
    * Monster
* Network! Go to meet-ups similar to this to meet people at different companies
#### Job Searching Tips and Tricks
* LinkedIn
    * Settings -> change to 'Open to New Opportunities'. When Recruiters are seaching for candidates, the 'Open to New Opportunities' profiles will pull to the front! You will be messaged quicker and more often
    * Make sure it looks professional
        * Bullet points of duties are articulate and full of grammatically correct content
        * You have a professional, clear picture
        * You have an overview section of your skillset and what you are looking to do
    * Talk to any and all recruiters that ping you! You never know what they might be offering
* Information to keep when talking to recruiters:
    * Company Name
    * Job Title/Description
    * Date your Resume was submitted

### Interviewing
* Transparency
    * Be open and honest about your interview process. How far along you are in the process, any offers on the table, timelines, salary you'd like, etc.
* Know Your Resume
    * It is important to know your resume like the back of your hand! Being able to articulate your projects, past work, and strengths confidently and thoroughly is very important to impressing a future employer
* Have Questions Prepared
    * Whether with a Recruiter or the Hiring Manager, always have at least 3 questions prepared about the opportunity. This can be about day-to-day duties, opportunity for growth, or language they code in, but coming in unprepared with no questions typically hurts your changes or moving forward.
