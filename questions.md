## This is where I will stage all of my questions for the Teachers and TAs and all of the corresponding answers.

* Q: Are there other similar coding workshops available in other areas? Such as like Atlanta, do they have a similar programming course to our Innovate Birmingham?
* A: There is one that is identical to iBham in Denver but these are the only ones that are free. Most other courses in other areas you have to pay for. The course, Covalance, is available online but it does cost.

* Q. Using CSS Bootstrap in HTML, how do I align a badge on the right of the screen while the text in the list is on the left of the screen?
* A. Adding the classes *d-flex* and *justify-content-between*

* Q. What kind of attire is acceptable for the headshot on friday?
* A. Button-down shirt (no dark colors) prefered with a blazer or tie.

* Q. Which is better in react, function-based components or class-based components?
* A. Function-based is generally better than class-based but there are certain cases where class-based is necessary, usually involving access to certain states and props. Most current react apps are class-based but are transitioning to functional.
